- This is the 1.1 release. IPv6 is now supported for printing and printer detection.
- We now really use only port 8611 for printer detection.
- The long standing "failed to read side channel" bug is solved.
  The source code has received a major overhaul: lots of refactoring. The code has been
  split into a number of C-files. The protocol depedent definitions are now in a
  separate header file

2011-06-25
- This is the 1.0 release. Not that much changed, but the package is apparently ok as is
  In this release some unused code is removed and the name resolution is changed to
  verify after a reverse lookup that a normal (forward) lookup indeed returns the right
  ip-address. This fixes the case where a buggy name server (some CPE) returns a bogus
  name. Some IPv6 related fixes.

2009-05-29 0.5.4
- This release only changes the rpm-spec handling in preparation for release in Fedora.
  There are no other functional changes. So for most people there is no need to update.

2009-02-11 Version 0.5
- Corrected a bug where the backend would crash during printer discovery when it encountered 
  a point to point link.
- Added autoconf/automake support.

2008-11-18 Fourth beta release
- Added keep-alive for TCP connection as printer may time out if for any reason (slow filter)
  connection is inactive for 30 sec (reportd by ZEDO)
- added a 15 sec delay at end of printjob as printer may otherwise not accept new printjob
  (also reported by Zedo)
- Rewrote specfile so it works for all redhat based releases

2008-08-09 Second beta release
- added out of paper support
- improved logging/debugging support:
  Normally we log to the cups error log
  For debugging of printer discover we can set env. var BJNP_DEBUG
  For debugging of printing we can set the debuglevel as part of the device URI:
      bjnp://printer-1.pheasant:8611/?debuglevel=DEBUG
  Debugging levels are named as in CUPS

2008-08-07 First beta release of CUPS-bjnp.
- This release adds a number of additions over the alpha versions released before on fazant.net:
- Adds spec files for Fedora and Centos 5 (RHEL5)
- Compiles without the need for the CUPS sources
- Supports CUPS 1.2 and 1.3 with the same source files
- Ink level support is not included but planned to be added to Turboprint
