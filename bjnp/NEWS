2008-08-07 First beta release of CUPS-bjnp.

This release adds a number of additions over the alpha versions released before on fazant.net:
- Adds spec files for Fedora and Centos 5 (RHEL5)
- Compiles without the need for the CUPS sources
- Supports CUPS 1.2 and 1.3 with the same source files

Ink level support is not included but planned to be added to Turboprint

2008-08-09 Second beta release
- added out of paper support
- improved logging/debugging support:
  Normally we log to the cups error log
  For debugging of printer discover we can set env. var BJNP_DEBUG
  For debugging of printing we can set the debuglevel as part of the device URI:
      bjnp://printer-1.pheasant:8611/?debuglevel=DEBUG

  Debugging levels are named as in CUPS

2008-11-18 Fourth beta release
- Added keep-alive for TCP connection as printer may time out if for any reason (slow filter)
  connection is inactive for 30 sec (reportd by ZEDO)
- added a 15 sec delay at end of printjob as printer may otherwise not accept new printjob
  (also reported by Zedo)
- Rewrote specfile so it works for all redhat based releases

2009-02-11 Version 0.5
- Corrected a bug where the backend would crash during printer discovery when it encountered 
  a point to point link.
- Added autoconf/automake support.

2009-05-29 0.5.4
- This release only changes the rpm-spec handling in preparation for release in Fedora.
  There are no other functional changes. So for most people there is no need to update.
